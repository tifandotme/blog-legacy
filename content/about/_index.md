# History

1. My first computer was a Pentium 4, custom PC with Windows XP on it.
2. Long windows users, until I learn about FOSS and start to lean to it.
3. Then, about 3 years ago, I made the switch to GNU/Linux.

# Hobbies

## Video games

Ah yes, I used to love playing video games. PC games that is. But not much since I enter university. Here is a list of video games I used to play *and* finish:

- Minecraft
- The Witcher 3 (my favorite)
- And more..

## Movies

**Marvel Cinematic Universe**. Yes you heard it right. I said it first and even emphasize it. Truth is, Disney is just too big and probably will take over earth with their line of big budget movies.

Despite MCU overshadowing other action movies. I like other movies too. Here's my list of some favourite:

- Interstellar, Inceptions. Most of Christopher Nolan movies are a masterpiece.
- The list are endless..
