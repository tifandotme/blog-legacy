Above are results of two different web analytics provider. You can see the drastic difference on the **script** section.

- Google Analytics = 77.2 KB
- Microanalytics = 0.8 KB (less than 1 KB!)

# Google Analytics

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) is de facto analytic reporting platform that almost every web developer know and used. Yet I find that it is too bloated and a bit overkill.

# Microanalytics

[Microanalytics](https://microanalytics.io) is a great alternative for anyone that just want lightweight and privacy-focused analytics without unnecessary features that would otherwise be unutilized. It also has a generous free plan until a maximum of 5K pageviews a month.
