# Introduction

Welcome to the Future Authoring component of the Self-Authoring suite. This exercise has been designed to allow you to do an in-depth analysis of some of the virtues and faults of your personality

The exercise may take up to five hours to complete. You can come back to the exercise later, and resume your work.

# Instructions

The full future authoring exercise has 2 different stages

- In Stage 1, you will write generally about your goals.
- In Stage 2, you will specify and clarify the nature of those goals, and begin to strategize.

We recommend that you complete the process over **two or more separate days**. On the first day, you might want to complete Stage 1. On the second day, you could complete Stage 2. People who allow themselves some time to sleep when they are making important decisions appear to do a better job and to benefit more.

You will need to concentrate and process what you are writing, so try to **complete this exercise when you are feeling alert and relatively unrushed**. If you need to take a short break or two of 5-10 minutes to get up and walk around during the process, please feel free to do so. You will be asked to write down your private thoughts and feelings.

Some answers have minimum and maximum characters. These limitations have been established so that you do not get stalled at any point in the process. We do encourage you to **write in some detail**, however, subject to those limitations. Our research indicates that better results are obtained as the amount written by participants increases.

# Answers

## The Ideal Future: Preliminary Notes and Thoughts

In this exercise you will begin to create a version, in writing, of your ideal future. **Brainstorm**. Write whatever comes to mind. **Don't worry too much about sentence construction, spelling, or grammar**. There will be plenty of time to write polished sentences later. Avoid criticizing what you write. Premature criticism interferes with the creative process.

William James, the great American psychologist, once remarked that he did not know what he thought until he had written his thoughts down. When he didn't know what to write, he wrote about anything that came to mind. Eventually, his ideas became focused and clarified.

## Imagining Your Ideal Future

You will start with some exercises of imagination that will help you warm up to the task of defining your future.

**Let yourself daydream or fantasize**. You are trying to put yourself into a state of reverie, which is a form of dream-like thinking that relies heavily on internal imagery. This kind of thinking allows all your different internal states of motivation and emotion to find their voice.
