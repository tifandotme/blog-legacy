Tonight I just randomly start a conversation with Mr. R. I asked about why he changed his motorcycle. Then about 3 minutes in, He asked me to come eat together with his group.</p><p>We mostly chatted about past events that occurred while they work. The good and bad experience. Rants about our boss. .. And adult humor. You know, night life in the city. After our gathering. I am asked to join them the next day.</p><h1 id=why>Why</h1><p>I have known to be a quiet person at my workplace. I rarely approach someone or a group. Only if I need to talk to them about work. I know this attitude might not be ideal as far as the society concerns. My anxiety is probably to blame which I am trying to improve.</p><p><strong>One thing that strikes me</strong> after the event with Mr. R is that I experience a sense of freedom. As if <strong>nothing matters</strong>. I can act freely with them without worrying the outcome. It does not mean that I am free to do immoral things. I try to keep a positive vibe. <em><strong>Why don&rsquo;t I have this courage before?</strong></em></p><h1 id=takeaway>Takeaway</h1><ul><li>Just start a conversation and be interested.</li><li>People are usually nice if you&rsquo;re interested to talk to them.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the outcome. Have the mindset &ldquo;Why if I will be gone tomorrow?&rdquo;</li><li>Be yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry if they like/dislike you.</li></ul></article><footer><a href=https://github.com/tifandotme/tifan.me/edit/main/content/personal/left-my-job.md style=align-self:flex-end;padding:0 target=_blank>Edit post</a>
